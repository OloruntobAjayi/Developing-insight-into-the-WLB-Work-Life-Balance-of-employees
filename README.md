## Problem Statement:

The task involves identifying job titles in the "Software Development" department based on specific criteria. This includes filtering roles with a work-life balance rating and salary/benefits rating greater than 4, handling null values, and creating a new column categorizing overall job qualities. The problem statement is to efficiently analyze and categorize job titles in the software development department based on specified criteria, incorporating data cleaning and classification logic.

## Skill and Concept Demonstrated:

It demonstrated a range of essential data management skills, such as:
- Established and employed databases by executing CREATE and USE commands.
- Imported data using IMPORT FLAT FILE.
- Utilized SELECT, SELECT DISTINCT, FROM, and WHERE clauses for data retrieval.
- Employed ROUND (AVG()) to calculate rounded averages.
- Utilized REPLACE, UPDATE, and SET for data manipulation.
- Employed logical operators such as AND, OR, IS NULL, and comparison operators (GREATER/LESS THAN, EQUAL TO).
- Utilized CASE, WHEN, and THEN for conditional logic.
- Employed ALTER TABLE, ADD, and VARCHAR for adjusting table structures.


## Data Visualization and Analysis

### *Modifying the dataset*
In refining the dataset for heightened accuracy, SQL commands were instrumental. SELECT, SELECT DISTINCT, FROM, and WHERE clauses were harnessed for precise data retrieval. ROUND (AVG()) facilitated the calculation of meticulously rounded averages. Data manipulation was achieved using the REPLACE, UPDATE, and SET commands. Logical operators (AND, OR, IS NULL) and comparison operators (GREATER/LESS THAN, EQUAL TO) ensured nuanced data refinement. Additionally, CASE, WHEN, and THEN were employed to implement detailed conditional logic, guaranteeing thorough and accurate modifications to the dataset.This is shown below:

In conclusion, the analysis provides a comprehensive categorization of employees' quality of life based on various ratings. To address concerns about poor quality of life, a deeper dive into the data is recommended. Senior Analysts, Software Consultants (Python), and Associate Consultants exhibit top ratings, warranting further investigation into their work-performance correlation. By narrowing down the data, insights into the distribution of employees across excellent, good, and poor ratings can offer a holistic view of job satisfaction. Six key insights are:
1. **Job Title Influence:** Senior Analysts, Software Consultants (Python), and Associate Consultants excel in work-life balance and salary/benefits.
2. **Performance Relationship:** A detailed exploration of these high-rated job titles can unveil insights into their work performance.
3. **Quality of Life:** Assessing the distribution of employees across excellent, good, and poor ratings provides a broader understanding of overall job satisfaction.
4. **Investigation Focus:** Prioritizing investigation on employees with poor quality of life can uncover contributing factors.
5. **Majority Satisfaction:** Determining whether the majority of employees fall into excellent or good categories helps gauge overall job satisfaction levels.
6. **Strategic Decision-Making:** These insights guide strategic decision-making, enabling the company to address concerns, optimize employee satisfaction, and enhance overall work quality.
